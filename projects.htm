    <h3>CHRIS-bot</h3>
        <p>CHRIS-bot (Chemistry Human Robot Interaction System Robot) was a summer-long project in conjunction with the Army Research Laboratory.
            This was part of Jaci's position as an X-Force Fellow with the National Security Innovation Network.
            CHRIS-bot is capable of taking verbal human instruction and performing movement and chemistry-related tasks. It was set in the
            context of the Ohio Train Derailment of an example in how technology, specifically artificial intelligence, can aid first responders
            in cases of national emergencies. </p>
        <p>CHRIS-bot was coded in Python, using SpaCy to perform word similarity reporting to dictate what command the robot
            should execute. In addition, Jaci gained significant research experience. The technical report on CHRIS-bot is currently
        under review.</p>

    <h3>Van Gogh Creator</h3>
        <p>The Van Gogh Creator was a group project in Python that used CycleGAN to analyze Vincent Van Gogh paintings, then apply 
            what the machine learned to pictures that we fed it. It would then return those pictures, but with a Van Gogh
            filter over it. In addition to the program itself, Jaci and her group gained experience in analytics of artificial
            intelligence models. The results are to the left. To see the
            program itself on Kaggle, click <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jacisouth/vangogh-more-like-fake-gogh?kernelSessionId=127510918">here.</a></p>

    <h3>Butterfly-Moth Identification</h3>
        <p>The Butterfly-Moth Identification system was another group project in Python. This program analyzed photos of 100 different
            species of moths and butterflies, and was then able to identify random pictures of moths and butterflies with a 97.5% accuracy.
            This program specifically utilized the Convolutional Neural Network AlexNet. To see the program on Kaggle, click

    <h3>Pixel Art Creator</h3>
        <p>In Fall 2023, Jaci's club, Association for Computing Machinery, participated in HackSI, a local hackathon. For this
            hackathon, they created a pixel paint-by-numbers generator. This program would take an image, break it down into pixels,
            color correct to get it down to just 20 different colors, then turn it into a paint-by-numbers by stripping the color,
            creating a legend, and populated each pixel with a number corresponding the correct color. This was then inputted into
            a website (picture above), where users could upload their picture and print the resulting paint-by-numbers. While the website is no longer
            up, you can view the slideshow over the project <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gRNUTklRApG-8yWpR3L6Xofxcm3orvJR_qpyHKyzN44/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
